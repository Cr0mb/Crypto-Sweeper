These projects are intended solely for educational purposes to help individuals understand the principles of cryptography and blockchain technology. It is important to recognize that attempting to generate Bitcoin wallets in the hope of randomly finding one with a balance is not a feasible strategy. This same logic applies to any tool that tries to work in any way the same as this.

The number of possible Bitcoin wallet combinations exceeds 76 trillion, making the odds of discovering an active wallet astronomically low. To put it into perspective, you are statistically far more likely to win the lottery every day for the rest of your life than to recover even a single wallet with fundsâ€”even over the course of a decade.

# Crypto-Sweeper
Crypto Sweeper is a Python-based cryptocurrency wallet generator and balance checker. It generates Bitcoin and Ethereum wallets using BIP-39 mnemonics and checks their balances via online APIs. If a wallet contains funds, it is saved to a file.


## Features

- Generate Bitcoin and Ethereum wallets from 12 or 24-word mnemonics
- Derive multiple Bitcoin address formats (Legacy, Nested SegWit, Native SegWit)
- Convert Ethereum addresses to checksum format
- Check wallet balances using public APIs
- Automatically save wallets with non-zero balances
- User-friendly terminal interface with color-coded output

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
```
pip install requests colorama bip_utils web3 eth_utils
```
